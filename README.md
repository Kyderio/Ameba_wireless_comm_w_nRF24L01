This project aims to port over the existing Arduino wireless communications with nRF24L01 modules to Ameba boards. 

Refer to [this guide](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-wireless-communication-nrf24l01-tutorial/). It teaches how to use the bi-directional communication between the arduino boards, where the Joystick at the first Arduino we will control the servo motor at the second Arduino, and vice versa, using the push button at the second Arduino we will control the LED at the first Arduino.

This project is still work in progress, will update once the code is ready.
